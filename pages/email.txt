/*Using Sendgrid to send email
While I did manage to get the above working, the configuration is actually much simpler with sendgrid, to the point of which you only need to have an API key. You’ll want to install the middleware nodemailer-sendgrid-transport and configure as follows:

const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')
const sgTransport = require('nodemailer-sendgrid-transport')

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(sgTransport({
  auth: {
    api_key: process.env.SENDGRID_API
  }
}))

const send = ({ email, name, text }) => {
  const from = name && email ? `${name} <${email}>` : `${name || email}`
  const message = {
    from,
    to: 'kevin@thecouch.nyc',
    subject: `New message from ${from}`,
    text,
    replyTo: from
  }

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    transporter.sendMail(message, (error, info) =>
      error ? reject(error) : resolve(info)
    )
  })
}
*/
